Dear $userinfo[username],

Your WSO has dropped off the first page in the Warrior Special Offer forum. For only $200 you can "Pay to Sticky" your WSO to get maximum exposure, attract more visits and increase your chances of getting sales. 

This will pin your WSO to the top of the Warrior Special Offer forum for 24 hours. We have limited it to only 4 spots to maximize your exposure. Once the 4 slots are sold there will be no more available for that day. Get in quick and sticky your WSO now!

The "Pay to Sticky" button will only appear if there are spots available.

Best Regards,
