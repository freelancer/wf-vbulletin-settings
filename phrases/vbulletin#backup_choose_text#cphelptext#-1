There are three backup options on this page. The first is to make a selective backup of certain tables. This will make a backup of the tables you select and dump it to screen. You then save the resulting page to your local computer. This is likely to make your browser time out if your database is of any significant size. We recommend you check the integrity of this type of backup after you make it and before you would actually need to restore it. e.g. Do It Now. :)<br /><br />

<b>Save data to file on server</b> is similar to how mysqldump works on the command line. This is still subject to PHP timing out, so we cannot recommend this one either if you have a choice. If you must use it, enter the path to and filename of the backup file you want to create. It can have any extension, though you might want to name it .sql to remind you what it is. As is noted on that page, PHP must have write access to the directory you specify. Usually this means you must CHMOD the directory 777. Consult your FTP documentation on how to do this.<br /><br />

<b>CSV Dump of data</b> produces a CSV (comma-separated values) file that can be imported via the command line or phpMyAdmin. This is also subject to PHP timeout as well as browser timeout since this, like the first option, is dumped to screen. You choose one table at a time, the separator character (note this; it is important when you import the file later), what quotes around the data should be, and whether or not to show column names.
