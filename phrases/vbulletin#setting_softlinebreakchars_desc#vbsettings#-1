When counting the number of lines in a signature, this setting controls the number of characters that can be displayed before text wraps in the browser and is displayed as multiple lines. Once this value is surpassed, the run of text will be counted as multiple lines.<br />

The value in this setting should be based on the number of <em>normal-sized</em> characters. Other sized characters will be scaled appropriately to this setting.
