This permission allows users to leave negative reputation.  Negative reputation only has half the effect of positive reputation.  For example, if a user has a reputation power of 20, they would only take 10 away by giving negative reputation. This permission requires that reputation be enabled in the vBulletin Options as well as the user having the "Can Use Reputation" permission enabled.
