On certain *NIX setups, including Linux, vBulletin can read the server's load as reported by the operating system. vBulletin can then use this information turn away users if the server load passes this threshold. Load on *NIX systems is measured in numbers. Usually load should stay below 1, however spikes can occasionally occur, so you should not set this number too low. A setting of 5 to 7 would be a reasonable threshold.
