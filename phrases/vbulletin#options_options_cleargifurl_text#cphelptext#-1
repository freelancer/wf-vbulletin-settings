The clear.gif file is used as a spacer in certain places on the forum and in place of missing avatars. If you do not set this to a valid image file, users may see a broken image symbol, depending on their browser. By default it is set to 'clear.gif' which indicates that the file is in the root folder of your vBulletin installation (the same folder as forumdisplay.php). This MUST be a relative URL from the location of the root folder of your vBulletin installation.
