<p class="smallfont">In order to provide products that are well-suited to the servers and sites that currently run vBulletin,
		we are running a survey to find out what kind of capabilities our customers' servers have, and what scale
		of bulletin boards they run.</p>
		<p class="smallfont">By submitting this survey to vBulletin.com you will help us to ensure that our forthcoming releases
		are both compatible with and make full use of the services available on your servers.</p>
		<p class="smallfont">There is some data at the bottom of the form that is optional for you to submit. This information
		describes your own board, and lets us know how busy etc. your site is.</p>
		<p class="smallfont">The information submitted in this survey is <strong>entirely anonymous</strong> and no information that can identify
		the site that posted the survey data will be collected.</p>
