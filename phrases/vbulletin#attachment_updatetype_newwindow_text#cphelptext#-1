The setting dictates how the attachment is displayed to the user.  It is common to have image attachments open in a new browser window/tab while you would want compressed files to open in the same window so that the application associated with the file type opens the file directly.  Opening a new window for this type of file will result in a blank window being opened for some browsers.
