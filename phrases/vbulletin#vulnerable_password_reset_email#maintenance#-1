Dear {username},

A vulnerability has been found with your password at {1}.  Some passwords are vulnerable to exploitation which may allow a third party to hijack your account.

This may lead to your account being used without your knowledge or permission, and actions being performed under your name.

Vulnerable accounts can also be bad for the board as a whole as they may enable access for automated tools to spam both the forums and other user accounts, 
using your username.

As such we have had to reset your password.
You can find your new login details below.

Username: {username}
Password: {password}

If you want to change your password, login with the above details at the following location:

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.



All the best,
{1}
