This is also the title of the prefix, but you may use HTML to add additional markup to the title. For example, you could turn a prefix red and bold by using: &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;For Sale&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This would look like this: <span style="color: red"><b>For Sale</b></span>.<br />

This version of the prefix will be shown in a list of threads and within the thread itself.
