Post elements are bits of information that can be displayed in the user information box in posts.  Put a check next to the elements you want to be displayed.<br /><br />

Keep in mind that these post elements add processing time to thread pages.  For example, to get a user's age vBulletin needs to do some math on the user's birth date and the current date in order to get an age out of it.  This calculation is done for each post being displayed on a thread page.  The additional overhead is small but is there nonetheless.  If you are wanting to optimize your forum for speed then you should disable these post elements.
