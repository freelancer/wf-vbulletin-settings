It is suggested that the number of featured entries is kept to a reasonable number.  There is no issue with creating many <em>specific</em> entries, but random and latest entries can be heavy on the system.  Every condition that is added to the entry (<em>usergroups</em>, <em>username</em>, etc) increases the amount of resources that is required to retrieve an entry.  These resources are utilized whenever the <em>refresh</em> period expires.  Obviously, choosing to refresh an entry every 30 minutes uses less resources than refreshing every 1 minute.
