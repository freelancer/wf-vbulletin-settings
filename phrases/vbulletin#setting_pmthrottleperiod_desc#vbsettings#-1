This setting allows you to specify a time period in minutes for limiting the amount of private messages sent by the user.  The amount of private messages that can be sent within this time period is defined by the user's usergroup permissions.<br /><br />

<strong>Note:</strong> If this is set to 0 then no throttle will be enforced.
