This is the maximum number of lines users of this group may have in their signatures. Unfortunately, due to browser and style variations, this is not an exact science and should only be used as a rough guide.<br />

Soft linewrapping can cause one contiguous string of text to be counted as multiple lines. The number of characters that are allowed before this text is treated as multiple lines is controlled by the &quot;<a href="options.php?do=options&amp;dogroup=user">Signature Soft-Linebreak Character Limit</a>&quot; option. Text that is not the default size is scaled to count as more or less characters than normal.
