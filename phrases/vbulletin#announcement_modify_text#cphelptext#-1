On this screen, all of your announcements are listed, ordered by start date.<br /><br />

At the top are global announcements; these show in all forums. There is a button labeled New that you can click to add a new global announcement. (If you don't currently have any global announcements, this section will not show. In this case, to add a new global announcement, click Add New Announcement in the navigation bar.)<br /><br />

Below that you will find a list of every forum, along with lists of announcements in each forum. Remember that just because an announcement is listed here does <i>not</i> mean it is viewable by the end-user. Announcements are not automatically deleted after their end date - you must manually remove them (by clicking the Delete link next to the announcement), or you can reactivate them (by clicking the Edit link next to the announcement and choosing a new end date that is after today's date).<br />
You can view the announcements as your users see them by clicking on a forum name.<br /><br />

To create a new announcement in a specific forum, click the New button across from that forum name.
