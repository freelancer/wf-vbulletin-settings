<b>User Ranks:</b><br />
Users ranks are rank insignia based on post count and usergroup that are displayed next to names in posts.  User ranks work very similar to user titles, the main difference being that user titles are for all usergroups while user ranks can be created for specific usergroups.  In this way you can create different rank insignia for different usergroups.  User ranks appear next to names in posts.
