If this is set to Yes, this usergroup will be able to view events that others have posted on this calendar. Otherwise, those events will not be visible to this group.<br /><br />
Please note, the way events work has been changed from vBulletin 2.2.x. The idea of "public" and "private" events has been changed to a single event type; therefore, there is now only one option regarding posting events. Whether or not events are "public" is determined by this setting. If it is set to Yes, events on this calendar would be "public". Otherwise they would be "private". (see <a href="help.php?do=answer&amp;page=calendarpermission&amp;pageaction=edit&amp;option=canpostevent">Can Post Calendar Events</a>)
