If an image is larger than your maximum allowed dimensions or filesize, an attempt to resize it will be tried.  This may fail if the image is too large to be successfully processed or if the image type is not supported for resizing. When this option is enabled, you should limit the Attachment Input options above to one, otherwise the uploading of multiple large images by one user could strain your server.
