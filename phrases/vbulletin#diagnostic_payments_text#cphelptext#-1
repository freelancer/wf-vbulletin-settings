This page tests your active payment processors to make sure they are working with the parameters you have set in the <a href="subscriptions.php?do=api" target="_blank">Payment API Manager</a>.  If anything below fails, then that means the corresponding payment processor is not currently working with your forum - that means you either set the wrong parameters for that processor or something is wrong with the processor itself.
