<b>Forums:</b><br />
There are two kinds of forums, a forum and a category.  Forums can allow new threads and posts while categories cannot.  Categories are used to group forums by topic.  Forums of related topics are typically created as children of a parent category to group them by topic.<br /><br />

When adding / editing a forum there is an option called "Act as Forum".  When this option is set to "Yes" the forum will act as a forum.  When this option is set to "No" the forum will act as a category.
