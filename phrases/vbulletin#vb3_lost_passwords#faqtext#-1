<p><b>I forgot my password. What can I do?</b></p>

<p>If you forget your password, you can click on the '<a href="login.php?$session[sessionurl]do=lostpw">Forgotten Your Password</a>' link. This will appear on any page that requires you to fill in your password.</p>

<p>This link brings up a page where you should enter your registered email address. An email will be sent to that address shortly, with instructions for resetting your password.</p>

<p>Since passwords are encrypted, there is no way to resend your original password. This option provides you with the ability to reset your password.</p>

<p>You must be able to receive emails to your registered email address for this to work. You may need to check your spam filters and folder if you do not see this email in a few minutes.</p>
