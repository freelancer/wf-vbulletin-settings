Allow users to delete attachments from threads that are closed? If you have attachment quotas enabled then you might need this option enabled to allow users to delete attachments once they reach their quota. The user will still need permission to edit posts in the forum for this to apply. If the above option is set to NO then this option will only apply up to the edit time limit setting.
