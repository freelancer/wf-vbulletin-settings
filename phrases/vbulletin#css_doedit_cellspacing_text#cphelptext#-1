This is the cellspacing attribute of your forum tables.  The larger this number, the farther apart vBulletin's table cells will be from eachother.<br /><br />

An example of a table cell is one of the boxes on your <a href="../{$vbulletin->options[forumhome]}.php" target="_blank">forumhome</a> page that contains a linked forum name and its description.
