This option controls the number of days worth of data that will be used to create the usage-based tag cloud shown <a href="../blog_tag.php" target="_blank">here</a>. Any tags added outside this range will not be taken into account for the tag cloud.<br />

The tag cloud can serve as a list of what's popular on your blog. You can use this option to prevent what was popular earlier from skewing against what's popular now.
