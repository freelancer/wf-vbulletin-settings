However, it's also a link. When Site B receives the notification signal, it automatically goes back to Site A checking for the existance of a live incoming link, if it exists, the Pingback is recorded successfully. This makes Pingbacks less prone to SPAM than Trackbacks.</p>
<p>Both sites must be Pingback enabled in order to establish this communication. If a site is Pingback enabled, each time you link-out you will be &quot;pinging&quot; external sites. Pingback requires for Site A to phisically link to Site B.</p>

<p>A Pingback will be registered in our forums by simply linking back to a thread or post from a Pingback enabled website.</p>
<p>Note: If the forum administrator requires moderation for Incoming Pingbacks, a link-back to the site originating the Pingback will be published only after the Pingback has been manually approved by a moderator.</p>
<p>Once a Pingback has been published, an automated notification email will be sent to the thread contributors.</p>

<p>Note: If the Pingback recipient site requires moderation for Pingbacks, a link-back to the thread originating the Pingback will be published only after the Pingback has been manually approved by the recipient's site administrator.</p>
