Enter characters to filter/replace in auto tags before they are submitted, this can be useful if a specific combination of characters causes odd tags to be created or if you want to extend a tag.<br/><br/>Enter each item on a new line and ensure that term and replacement are enclosed in single quotes (i.e. '*'). The lack of spaces before and after the => is important, filter and replacement must be quoted with single quotes.  This items are processed in the order they appear in the list, so if you filter <strong>'</strong> before you filter <strong>'s</strong> the filter/replacement will not work.<br/><br/>This is NOT case sensitive and it also check escaped items, so if you enter '"', '\"' will also be filtered/replaced.<br/><br/>As mention this can also be used to extend a tag, so if you forum relates to motorbikes you could replace <strong>GSXR</strong> with <strong>Suzuki GSXR</strong> with the following rule:<br/><br/>'GSXR'=>'Suzuki GSXR'
