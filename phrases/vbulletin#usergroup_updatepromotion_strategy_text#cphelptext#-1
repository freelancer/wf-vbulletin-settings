Select which of the above conditions must be true for this promotion to be invoked.  Conditions inside parenthesis are evaluated first.<br /><br />

For example, if these are your settings:<br /><br />

Reputation Comparison Type = Greater or Equal to<br />
Reputation Level = 1000<br />
Days Registered = 30<br />
Posts = 100<br />
Promotion Strategy = Posts and (Reputation or Date)<br /><br />

...and the user has 1100 reputation, has been registered for 20 days, and has 150 posts then they would be promoted because:<br /><br />

Posts: 150 >= 100 (true)<br />
Reputation: 1100 >= 1000 (true)<br />
Date: 20 >= 30 (false)<br /><br />

...and so using the "Posts and (Reputation or Date)" promotion strategy:<br /><br />

true and (true or false)<br />
= true and (true)<br />
= true
