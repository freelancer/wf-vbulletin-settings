This is the path to the images you are adding. This should be relative from your main vBulletin directory. For example, if your directory structure looks like this:<br />
- vBulletin<br />
-- images<br />
--- avatars<br />
--- icons<br />
--- smilies<br />
and you were uploading a smiley, you would type<br />
images/smilies<br />
Do not put a filename on this path, and do not put a trailing slash on it either.
