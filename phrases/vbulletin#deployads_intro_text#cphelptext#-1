<p>vBulletin offers two different Google AdSense packages. Each package will implement a different set of advertising units into the forum advertising templates. You may also control the type of ad that is delivered in each unit.</p>

<p><b>Type of Ads to Show</b></p>

<p>With this option, you may control the type of ads delivered by Google AdSense.</p>

<ul><li>Text ads only: AdSense will only show ads consisting of text and links.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Text and image ads: AdSense will only show advertistments that contain images if possible but fall back to text-only ads if necessary. This is the recommended option.</li></ul>

<p><b>No Google AdSense Ads</b></p>

<p>This option will remove all Google AdSense code from the vBulletin forum advertising templates.</p>

<p><b>Low Package Ad Units</b></p>

<p>The Low package adds two small advertising units to the main forum pages:</p>

<ul><li>Below the header navigation bar: Horizontal link unit with 5 contextual links to related advertising. This unit is always text. Ad unit color same as background.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Below the page content, above the footer: Small, horizontal advertising block. Ad unit color same as background.</li></ul>

<p><b>High Package Ad Units</b></p>

<ul><li>Below the header navigation bar: Medium, horizontal advertisting block. Ad unit color contrasts with background.</li></ul>
