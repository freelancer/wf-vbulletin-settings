The <em>Restrict entry viewing to Contacts and Blog Moderators</em> option will restrict the viewing of an entry to just those members on your contact list and to Blog moderators.  This allows you to leave your blog open to all members but still have the ability to restrict viewing on an entry to entry basis.
