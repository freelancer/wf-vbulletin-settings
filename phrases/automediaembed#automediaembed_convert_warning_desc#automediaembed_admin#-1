It is strongly advised that you back up your posts table before running this tool as the changes made are permenant. I would also strongly advise running in test and verbose mode to check out the changes that would be made before actually making them. Finally, I would strongly advise you to check out the help topics (click the ? icons next to each setting) to fully understand the sytstem.
