You may set the amount of days that albums are relevant in the Recently Updated Albums list.  You may want to increase this value if picture updates are infrequent, or vice versa.<br /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> If user album permissions are changed, the Recently Update Album list can be rebuilt with <a href="misc.php?do=chooser">Rebuild Counters</a>.

If you set this to 0, Recently Updated Albums will be disabled.
