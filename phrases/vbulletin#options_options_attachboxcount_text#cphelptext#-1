This setting limits how many attachments can be uploaded at one time.  This does not limit how many total attachments can be uploaded per post.<br /><br />

For example, if a user wants to attach 5 files to their post (assuming you allow at least 5 attachments per post) and you only allow 3 files to be uploaded at a time (this setting), then the user will need to select and upload 3 of the 5 files first and then select and upload the last 2 files after the first 3 are done.
