This page allows you to moderate threads and posts that are awaiting moderation.  Below are all threads and posts that are awaiting moderation (if any).  Select an action for each thread and post (validate, delete, or ignore) and click the "Save" button to continue.<br /><br />

Validating a thread or post removes it from this moderation queue and makes it visible on the forums.  Deleting a thread or post does exactly that.  Ignoring a thread or post leaves it in this moderation queue so you can handle it another time.<br /><br />

If you want to validate, delete, or ignore all threads and posts awaiting moderation then you can click the appropriate button at the top which sets all actions appropriately.<br /><br />

You can edit the content of threads and posts on this page while moderating them.  For example, a thread might have an inappropriate title... just change the text for the title and then validate the thread.
