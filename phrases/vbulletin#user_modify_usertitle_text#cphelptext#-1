Enter the text that the user's title must contain. This is applicable even if you don't allow custom user titles, since the user title of every user is stored with their username, so default group titles would be searched as well. See <a href="help.php?do=answer&amp;page=user&amp;pageaction=modify&amp;option=username">Username Contains</a> for more information on the string matching used here.
