If set to 'Yes', all pictures uploaded to user albums are placed into a moderation queue for approval by board staff before being visible to site visitors.<br />

It may be a legal requirement to enable this option in some cases, such as for boards run in Germany.<br />

If you would like to have all images from only certain usergroups sent to the moderation queue, the usergroup editor provides this ability.
