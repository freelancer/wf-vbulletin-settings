This setting throttles the level of GZIP compression for outgoing pages.  A higher number means more compression at the expense of increased processing time per page request.<br /><br />

The valid numbers are 0 (none) through 9 (maximum).  Most people use level 1 compression because it offers the greatest compression per unit of work for the server.  Higher numbers have diminishing returns.
