For example, if this is set to 2 and your forums are arranged like this:<br /><br />

parent<br />
--child<br />
----child's child<br /><br />

And you are currently viewing the "parent" forum then you will see the first two levels of the parent forum's subforums on the forumdisplay page:<br /><br />

--child<br />
----child's child
