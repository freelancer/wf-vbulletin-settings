This is the HTML that is displayed once the text is parsed. <p>Note that this is where you use the back reference created in the regular expression above. You can place a couple of different variables in here for processing<ul><li>$url - is the full URL being passed</li><li>$title - is either the title of the URL (if it exists) or the title of the entry</li><li>$p1, $p2, $p3, $p4 and $p5 are all backreferences that represent different parts of your regular expression above. These are the variables you will most likely be using in this section</li></ul></p><p>It is also worth pointing out that changes here may not be seen right away in the posts. New posts are often cached by vBulletin (depending on your settings) and are not always processed by the bbcode parser. If you make changes to this area, you may want to use the rebuild posts tool to rebuild the posts with AME tags within the time frame that vBulletin is caching your posts (i.e. posts within the last day/week)</p>
