This is the path to the image. This should be relative from your main vBulletin directory. For example, if your directory structure looks like this:<br />
- vBulletin<br />
-- images<br />
--- avatars<br />
--- icons<br />
--- smilies<br />
<br />
and your smiley was called tongue.gif and located in the smilies directory, you would specify:<br />
images/smilies/tongue.gif
