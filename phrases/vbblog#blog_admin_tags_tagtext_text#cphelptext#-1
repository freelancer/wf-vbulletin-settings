Thread tagging is a system that allows user to apply their own keywords (tags) to threads. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_%28metadata%29" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> for more information on the ideas behind tagging.<br />

This area allows you to manage the existing tags and create new ones. Note that you cannot create tags that your normal users would not be able to use. This means that you can't violate the length options or used censored words.
