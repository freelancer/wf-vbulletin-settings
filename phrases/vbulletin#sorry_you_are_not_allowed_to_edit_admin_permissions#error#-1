<b>Sorry, you are not allowed to edit administrator permissions.</b><br /> <br /> If you think you <i>should</i> have permission to access this page, you will need to edit the <i>$config['SpecialUsers']['superadministrators']</i> variable in the <i>includes/config.php</i> file.<br /> <br /> To allow the administrators to access this page, edit the variable to include the user IDs of those administrators should have access, separating each user ID with a comma, like this:<br /> <br /> <code>$config['SpecialUsers']['superadministrators'] = '1,25,57';</code><br /> <br /> To allow only a single administrator to access this page, simply add that user's ID with no commas, like this:<br /> <br /> <code>$config['SpecialUsers']['superadministrators'] = '1';</code>
