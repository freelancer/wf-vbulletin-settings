	If for whatever reason the UNIQUE indexes in your database
	have been lost (usually this happens after importing an
	incomplete or corrupt SQL dump) you may find strange behavior,
	particularly when using the language and template systems.<br />
	<br />
	This system will attempt to correct the problem and rebuild your
	UNIQUE indexes.<br />
