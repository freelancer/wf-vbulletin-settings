On this screen you can edit, or translate, phrases. A phrase is a bit of text, referred to in the templates. Each language you have consists of all phrases translated into that language.<br /><br />

Each phrase row gives the phrase name (that is, how it is shown in the templates), the phrase as it exists for that language (translated or not), and a link to revert a phrase to the default (English) value. Make sure to click Save Changes to save your work on this page.
