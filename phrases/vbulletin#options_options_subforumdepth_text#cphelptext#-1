Use this option to display deep subforums as text links in the parent's forum description area.<br /><br />

For example, if your forums are setup like this:<br /><br />

parent<br />
--child<br />
----child's child<br /><br />

And your forum depth is set to 2 and this setting is set to 3 then you will see the first two forums displayed "fully" on the forum homepage while the level 3 "child's child" forum will appear within the "child" forum's description:<br /><br />

parent<br />
--child<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>child forum's description.</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sub-Forums:</b> child's child
