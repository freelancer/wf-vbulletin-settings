If set to 'Yes', all comments are placed into a moderation queue for approval by board staff before being visible to site visitors.<br />

If you would like to have all comments from only certain usergroups sent to the moderation queue, the usergroup editor provides this ability. This ability can also be set by a blog owner for each entry.
