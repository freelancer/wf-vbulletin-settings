This is the date and time the user must have visited after to be found. The date and time format is yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss; for example, 2002-08-30 10:15:00 will find all users who visited after August 30, 2002 at 10:15:00 AM. This criteria can be used in conjunction with the Last Visit is Before criteria to create a finite range of last visit dates. Keep in mind that if you use both, this date and time must be BEFORE the Last Visit is Before date and time or no users will be found!
