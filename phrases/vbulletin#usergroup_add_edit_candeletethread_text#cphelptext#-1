This permission allows members of this group to delete their own threads.  This group must have post editing permissions (see "Can Edit Own Posts" permission above) if they are to delete a thread.  This permission refers to deleting threads by editing the first post in a thread, not by selecting the "Delete Thread" option from the "Thread Tools" menu.<br /><br />

Be careful with allowing thread deletion.  When a thread is deleted all of the posts in it are also deleted.  If you allow users to edit their posts indefinitely (see "Time Limit on Editing of Posts" setting <a href="options.php?dogroup=posting&amp;do=options" target="_blank">here</a>) as well as allow them to delete their threads, then they can go back into your forum history and delete <b>all</b> of their threads if they want.
