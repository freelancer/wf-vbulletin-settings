<p>We are ready to attempt to move your images from the filesystem to the database.</p>

<p>It is possible that you might not have enough space in the database, but we are unable to determine that ahead of time.</p>

<p>We will not finalize the move until the end of the process. If the process aborts before the end, you will need to free up space before trying again.</p>
