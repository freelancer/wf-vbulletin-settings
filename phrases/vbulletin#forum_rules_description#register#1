          <p><strong>DISPUTES</strong></p>
          <p><strong><em>Between Users</em></strong></p>
          <p>If there is a dispute between  users of the Website, or between users and any third party, you understand and  agree that Warrior Forum is under no obligation to become involved. In the  event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you hereby release  Warrior Forum, its officers, employees, agents and successors in rights from  claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind or nature,  known or unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising  out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or the Warrior Forum  Services. </p>
          <p><strong><em>With Warrior Forum</em></strong></p>
          <p><strong>Law and Jurisdiction</strong>. All questions of law, rights, and remedies regarding  any act, event or occurrence undertaken pursuant or relating to this Website or  the Warrior Forum Services shall be governed and construed by the law of the  State of New South Wales, Australia.&nbsp; With respect to any  disputes or claims not subject to informal dispute resolution or arbitration  (as set forth below), you agree not to commence or prosecute any action in  connection therewith other than in the state and federal courts located in  &nbsp;New South Wales, Australia, and you hereby consent to, and waive all  defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect  to, venue and jurisdiction in the state and federal courts located in New South Wales, Australia. Application of the United Nations Convention on  Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is excluded from this Agreement. In no event shall any claim, action or  proceeding by you related in any way to the Website and/or the Warrior Forum  Service (including your visit to or use of the Website and/or the Warrior Forum  Service) be instituted more than two (2) years after the cause of action arose.</p>
          <p><strong>Injunctive Relief</strong>. You acknowledge that the  rights granted and obligations made hereunder to Warrior Forum are of a unique  and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which shall irreparably harm Warrior  Forum and which cannot be replaced by monetary damages alone so that Warrior  Forum shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief (without the  obligations of posting any bond or surety) in the event of any breach or  anticipatory breach by you, and such relief may be sought in the courts of any  jurisdiction. You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other  equitable relief and agree to limit your claims to claims for monetary damages  (if any).</p>
          <p><strong>Negotiation</strong>. To expedite resolution and control the  cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this Agreement  (&quot;Dispute&quot;), you and Warrior Forum agree to first attempt to negotiate  any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at  least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding.  Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one person to the  other. You will send your notice to Warrior Forum at the address listed below.</p>
          <p><strong>Binding Arbitration</strong>. If you and Warrior Forum are  unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, either you or  Warrior Forum may elect to have the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly  excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any  election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. YOU  UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under  the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association  (&quot;AAA&quot;) and, where appropriate, the AAA&rsquo;s Supplementary Procedures  for Consumer Related Disputes (&quot;AAA Consumer Rules&quot;), both of which  are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. The determination of whether a  Dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration  Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Your arbitration fees  and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules  and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are  determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, Warrior Forum will pay all  arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person,  through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will  make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless  requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award  may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise  provided in this Agreement, you and Warrior Forum may litigate in court to  compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm,  modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. Except  where otherwise required by the AAA Consumer Rules, arbitration shall take  place in Sydney, Australia.</p>
          <p><strong>Restrictions</strong>. You and Warrior Forum agree that any  arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between Warrior Forum and you  individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be  joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be  arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and  (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported  representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>
          <p><strong>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and  Arbitration</strong>.  You and Warrior Forum agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the  above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (1)  any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any  of your or Warrior Forum&rsquo;s intellectual property rights; (2) any Dispute  related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy  or unauthorized use; and (3) any claim for injunctive relief.</p>
          <p><strong>Severable</strong>. If any arbitration provision is found to  be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor Warrior Forum will elect to  arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion found to be illegal or  unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent  jurisdiction within New South Wales, Australia, and you and Warrior Forum  agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
