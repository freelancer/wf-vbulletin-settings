You may use this option to apply a prefix to automatically posted threads. However, this prefix must be allowed in the destination forum. To ensure this is the case, note the prefix set of the prefix you wish to use. Go into the "Forum Manager", edit the destination forum for this RSS feed, and ensure that the correct prefix set (or sets) are selected.
