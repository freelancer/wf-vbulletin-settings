<p>The <em>Moderate comments before posting</em> option controls the visibility of comments. When this option is enabled, comments by anyone other than you and blog moderators are invisible until you approve them. If you are allowed to edit entries, you may turn this option on and off after an entry has been published to control the visibility of new comments as time passed.</p>

<p>You may set the default for this choice in the <span class="smallfont" style="font-weight: bold">Blog Control Panel</span>.</p>
