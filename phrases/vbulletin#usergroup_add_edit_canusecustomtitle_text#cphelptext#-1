If this option is enabled, members of this usergroup will be able to enter a custom title in the <a href="../profile.php?do=editprofile" target="_blank">Edit Profile</a> section of their User CP.  The custom title will be displayed in the user's posts and profile page in place of any title specified for their group or post count (see <a href="usertitle.php?do=modify" target="_blank">User Title Manager</a>).
