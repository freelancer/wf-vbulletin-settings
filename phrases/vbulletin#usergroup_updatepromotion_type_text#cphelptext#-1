Which promotion type to select depends on how you have your groups and permissions configured.  Generally speaking, if the promotion involves just a few changes to permissions and settings then it is easier to setup a new usergroup that grants the new permissions and settings, and then to have the promotion add membership to that group as an "Additional Usergroup."  If the promotion involves lots of changes then a "Primary Usergroup" change may be called for.
