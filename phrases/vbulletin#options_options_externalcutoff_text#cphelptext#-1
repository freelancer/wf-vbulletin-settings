This option controls how far back, a scan for updated posts will undertake.  The optimum setting it to choose a value that will generally result in 15 updated threads for guests. A busy forum will usually have 15 or more threads updated in an hour so the proper value for that forum would be to use <em>1</em>.  If a forum only receives a few updates a day, then increasing the value past 24 hours would be advisable.
