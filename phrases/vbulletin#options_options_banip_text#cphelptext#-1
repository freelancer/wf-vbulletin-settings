Enter any IP addresses you wish to ban in this box, separated by spaces. You can enter a full IP address, or any partial IP address. vBulletin starts at the beginning of an IP address and matches out. You should be very careful when banning IP addresses, especially partials, as you will in all likelihood hit at least one innocent person for every one who is a legitimate banning target, if you even manage to hit a legitimate target at all.
