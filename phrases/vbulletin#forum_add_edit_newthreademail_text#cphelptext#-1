Enter the email address(es) of anyone who should be notified when a new thread is made in this forum. Separate multiple addresses with a space. It is suggested that you do not enter moderators' email addresses here - you can select whether or not a moderator receives email notifications when adding that moderator. If you add a user's email address to both the "Post" and "Thread" email notifications, that person will receive two emails when a new thread is started.
