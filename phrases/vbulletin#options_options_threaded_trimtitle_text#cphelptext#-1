This setting is in reference to the post titles that are associated with posts in the tree of posts that is displayed in a pane at the top of a thread when using hybrid or threaded mode.<br /><br />

Limiting the length of these post titles in the pane can help to make the post tree more readable and prevent it from running off of the pane and forcing a horizontal scroll bar.  This becomes more of a problem with threads that have deep post trees.
