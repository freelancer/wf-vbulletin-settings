The user's most recent post must have been made after this date and time to be found. The date and time format is yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss; for example, 2002-08-30 15:02:12 would find all users who last posted after August 30, 2002 at 3:02:12 PM. This criteria can be used in conjunction with the Last Post is Before criteria to create a finite range of last post dates. Keep in mind that if you use both, this date and time must be BEFORE the Last Post is Before date and time or no users will be found!
