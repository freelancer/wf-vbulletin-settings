This option allows the user to keep their custom avatar in the event that they lose permission to upload custom avatars.

If the user is moved to an usergroup that doesn't allow custom avatars; the user's avatar will not be visible in posts, their profile, and the member's list unless this option is enabled.

This option does not allow the user to change their avatar. Usergroup permission is required to accomplish that task.

If the admin changes or gives an a user a custom avatar when the user doesn't have usergroup permission to have one, this option will be automatically enabled.
