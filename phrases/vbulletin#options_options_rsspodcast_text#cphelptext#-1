RSS Enclosure is a special tag that is added to the RSS2 feed that allows the first attachment to be served via 'podcasting'. The spec only supports one file per item, hence the limit to the first attachment.  Many aggregates, including iTunes, will recognize your attachment and offer it for download when your RSS2 feed is opened.  Some aggregates support all file types, while other support a limited set of files. iTunes only supports .m4a, .m4v, .mp3, .mp4, .mov, and .pdf.  Within the forum manager, for each forum, you can define further iTunes specific settings that may also be supported  by other aggregates.
