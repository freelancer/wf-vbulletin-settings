This is the HTML code that replaces the user-entered BB code. Make sure that you include '{param}' (without the quotes) to insert the text between the opening and closing BB code tags, and '{option}' for the parameter within the BB code tag. You can only use {option} if 'Use Option' is set to yes below.<br />
eg. [b]My Text[/b] turns into <b>My Text</b>. To create that tag, enter<br />
&lt;b&gt;{param}&lt;/b&gt;<br />
If you were to create a tag like the URL tag, you would use {option}. The URL tag can be used like this:<br />
[url]http://www.example.com[/url]<br />
which turns into<br />
<a href="http://www.example.com/">http://www.example.com/</a><br />
It can alternatively be used like this:<br />
[url=http://www.example.com/]My Site[/url]<br />
which would turn into this:<br />
<a href="http://www.example.com/">My Site</a><br />
This is actually two different tags with the same code to make it easy on the end-user.<br />
To create the first tag, you would enter<br />
&lt;a href="{param}"&gt;{param}&lt;/a&gt;<br />
To create the second, you would enter<br />
&lt;a href="{option}"&gt;{param}&lt;/a&gt;<br />
If you are using options, option is what is entered <b>within</b> the tag, e.g. www.example.com in the following:<br />
[url=www.example.com]<br />
{param} is what is entered <b>between</b> tags, e.g. My Site in the following:<br />
[url=www.example.com]My Site[/url]<br />
You will always use '{param}', but you will only use '{option}' when "Use Option?" is "yes" and you need a second bit of input from the user as in the above example.
