It is quite simple to make a backup of your database via Telnet or SSH. The process is the same via either method. After you have logged into your server and are at the command prompt, do the following.<br /><br />
Type <pre>mysqldump --opt -uUSERNAME -p DATABASENAME > /path/to/dump.sql</pre> and press Enter. (Replace USERNAME, DATABASENAME, and /path/to/dump.sql with your MySQL username, the database name, and the path and file name of where you want to place the backup.) You will be prompted for your password. Type it in and press Enter. You will be returned to the command prompt when the command finishes; this should take between 30 seconds and a few minutes to complete, depending on your database size.<br /><br />
Verify that you have a dump.sql in the /path/to area you specified. If you don't, and you didn't receive any errors, double-check the path you entered is where you are looking. If you are positive you are looking where you told it to place the file, ask your host to search the server for your file, or create another backup.
