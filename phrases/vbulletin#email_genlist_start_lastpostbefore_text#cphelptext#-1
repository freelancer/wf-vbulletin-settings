The user's last post must be before this date and time for the user to be found. The date and time format is yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss; for example, 2002-08-30 20:22:02 would find all users who last posted before August 30, 2002 at 8:22:02 PM. This criteria can be used in conjunction with the Last Post is After criteria to create a finite range of last post dates. Keep in mind that if you do use both, this date and time must be AFTER the Last Post is After date and time or no users will be found!
