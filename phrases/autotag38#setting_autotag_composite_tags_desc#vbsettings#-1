This configuration item allows you to specify <strong>composite tags</strong>, these are a collection of terms that should be treated as a single tag.  As an example a title of "I have a big red car" will result in tags of "big, red, car".  However if you specify a composite tag of "red car" the tags will be "big, red car".<br/><br/>These are processed before smart quotes so if you specify a composite tag of [amazing brown dog] and the user submits a title of [Check out this amazing "brown dog"] the tags will be "check, amazing brown dog"<br/><br/>Place each item on a new line, do not use quotes or square brackets unless you want these included in the composite tag.
