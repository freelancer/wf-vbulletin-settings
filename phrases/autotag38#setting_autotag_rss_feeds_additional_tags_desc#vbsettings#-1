Here you can specify additional tags that should be added threads generated by a specific incoming RSS feed. Format should be:<br/><br/><strong>X=>text</strong><br/><br/>Where X is the RSS feed ID and text is the additional tag.  For example:<br/><br/><strong>2=>General News</strong><br/><br/>Enter each item on a new line, these are added as defined here regardless of configured exclusions & filters/replacements.  You can specify multiple additional tags for a single RSS feed by entering the RSS feed ID twice (with a different text).
