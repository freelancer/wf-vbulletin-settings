On this screen, all of the holidays for your calendars are listed. You can choose to edit or remove any holiday, or add a new one using the button at the bottom of the screen.<br /><br />

Note that due to the complex methods used in determining the actual dates each year, several holidays are built-in and you cannot edit or remove them. (They can be disabled through a separate option on the Add / Edit Calendar screen.) These holidays include Easter, Ash Wednesday, Palm Sunday, and Pentecost.
