<p>The <em>Notify blogs linked within this blog entry</em> and <em>Send Trackback / Pingback to</em> options allow you to notify other blogs that you have posted an entry in regard to them. You should always include the link to the other blog entry in your entry. Once you send the pingback request, the other blog is going to request your entry and verify that you really did include the link.  If you are allowed to edit entries, you may still send pingback notices after the entry has been published.</p>
