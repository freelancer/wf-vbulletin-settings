<p><b>Can I use RSS to keep up with new posts?</b></p>

<p>If the administrator has enabled RSS syndication, this lets you view newly created threads in guest-viewable forums without visiting the board.</p>

<p>The feeds are currently provided in two formats, RSS and RSS v2.</p>

<p>Most modern browsers have facilities for reading RSS feeds and will automatically detect the availability of feeds on bulletin board pages.</p>

<p><b>How do I listen to podcasts?</b></p>

<p>A podcast is a means of distributing audio files (such as .mp3s) over the internet. They can be played on a wide range of media players and computers. If the board administrator has enabled this function, then you may sometimes see links to podcasts within threads.</p>

<p>Podcasts contained within threads are only accessible using RSS feeds.</p>
