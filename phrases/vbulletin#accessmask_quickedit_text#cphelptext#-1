On this screen you are given a list of every access mask currently in the system. For each mask, a row containing the affected user's name, the forum it applies to, and Yes/No/Default buttons appear. Yes means grant access, No means deny access, and Default means use the default usergroup/forum permission for that forum. (Setting any row to Default will remove that mask.) The 'All Yes', 'All No', and 'All Default' buttons allow you to quickly mass-set all radio buttons to the selection you choose.
