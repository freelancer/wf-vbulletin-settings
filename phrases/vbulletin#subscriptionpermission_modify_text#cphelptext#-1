From here you can deny access for any usergroup for a specific subscription. For each subscription you have, each usergroup is listed. If the name of the group is red, they are denied access to purchase the subscription. If the name is black, they have permission to purchase the subscription. To change permissions, click Edit next to the group name you wish to change, under the subscription you wish it to apply to.
