By default, if there is a problem sending an email to a user, the account password will not be reset.  Set this option to 'Yes' to reset accounts even if it was not possible to send a notification email.

It is highly recommended that you try to reset passwords without enabling this option.  It may be useful to turn this on if you are sure there is not a problem with the email server and only a small number of account resets persist to cause email errors.  This may be caused by user accounts with invalid or missing email addresses.
