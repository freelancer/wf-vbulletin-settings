This function allows you to disable all AJAX features or just a selection.<br />

Due to the nature of AJAX, some functions may not work fully with non-Latin languages without additional modules, such as IconV. For example, AJAX-based quick reply may work correctly on the board, but thread subscription emails do not display correctly. If something like this occurs for you, you should select "Disable Problematic AJAX Features".
