If you enable this option, a user's email address will be verified during registration by sending an email to it; the user must click a link in the email to confirm that they control the email address. If they do not click the link, the user will remain in the Users Awaiting Activation usergroup until they do so, or until you remove them. If you also enable the Moderate New Members setting above, the users will be required to complete email verification and then moved to the (COPPA) Users Awaiting Moderation group for your validation.
