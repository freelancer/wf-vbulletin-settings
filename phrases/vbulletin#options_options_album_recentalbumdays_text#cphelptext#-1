You may set the amount of days that albums are relevant in the Recently Updated Albums list.  You may want to increase this value if picture updates are infrequent, or vice versa.<br /><br />If user album permissions are changed then the Recent Abum Updates list may contain albums that are no longer accessible.  This can be fixed by rebuilding the list on the Rebuild Counters page.<br /><br />
