Enter the date that the user's birthday must be after to be found. The date format is yyyy-mm-dd; for example, 2002-08-30. Users without a birthday entered will be automatically excluded from the results of this search. This criteria can be used in conjunction with the Birthday is Before criteria to create a finite range of birthday dates. Keep in mind that if you use both, this date must be BEFORE the Birthday is Before date or it will not find any users!
