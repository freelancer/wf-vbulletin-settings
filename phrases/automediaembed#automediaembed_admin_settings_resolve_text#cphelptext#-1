When set to 'yes', AME attempts to find the name of the web page in the passed URL<em>if one does not already exists</em>. It is also essential for certain items (i.e. yahoo and dailymotion) to work as AME will need information from the web page in order to operate.<p>Note that some servers have restrictions on this function. If you are having problems with this feature, either disable it or ask your host to enable url wrappers for fetch_contents.</p><p>FYI: This process only occurs when creating/editing a post.
