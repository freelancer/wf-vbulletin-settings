Merge allows you to join two user accounts into one single account.
The source account will be combined into the destination account.<br />
<br />
Posts, threads, calendar events, private messages, post count, reputation, contacts, friends and ignore list will be combined.<br />
<br />
The combined user will still have the same permissions that the destination user had to begin with.
Any access masks or moderator ability that the source user had will not be transferred.<br />
