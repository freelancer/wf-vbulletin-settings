The user's most recent visit must have been before this date and time to be found. The date and time format is yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss; for example, 2002-08-30 10:15:00 would find users who last visited before August 30, 2002 at 10:15:00 AM. This criteria can be used in conjunction with the Last Visit is After criteria to create a finite range of last visit dates. Keep in mind that if you use both, this date and time must be AFTER the Last Visit is After date and time or no users will be found!
