Any holidays that you have added to the system, or those that appear on the Holiday Manager by default, will be shown if you set this to Yes. (Due to complex methods of determining the actual date of several holidays, including Easter, Ash Wednesday, Palm Sunday, and Pentecost, these are built-in, with a separate option to disable them below.)
