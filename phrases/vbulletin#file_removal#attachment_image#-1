Total Attachments Processed: {2}<br /><br />

We have completed moving attachments to the database. Presently, the attachments still remain in the filesystem but are being read from the database.
If you are sure that the process completed without incident, go ahead and select yes below to remove the attachments from the filesystem.<br /><br />
This step cannot be reversed and may take a few minutes depending on the number of attachments. Please be patient.<br /><br />
We will only be able to remove attachments and attachment directories that we have write permission to.  Normally this should be every attachment
but sometimes the permissions are not correct and the removal will fail. You will need to manually remove the attachments from the filesystem
in this event.
