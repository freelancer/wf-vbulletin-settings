In order to conserve resources, vBulletin will allow search results to be shared among users for one hour. The downside of this is that search results can appear out of order if a thread is updated in the interim. Example, a user searches for 'test' in last post order.  Thirty minutes later another user searches for test.  If the second search has the same parameters as the first (sort order, search type, etc) then vBulletin will use the cached result.  If the order of threads has changed because some have been posted to, the results will no longer be in date order.  This is a cosmetic issue that can be rectified by disabling this option.
