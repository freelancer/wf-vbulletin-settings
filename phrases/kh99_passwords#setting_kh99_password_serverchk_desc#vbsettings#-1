This will check the password when the form is submitted to the server.<br /><br />
When set to 'Yes', this option will disable the "password clearing" function, allowing the user's password to be sent to the server in plain text on registration and password change (and if the login check option is set to yes, when they log in). But if this option is set to 'No', a user with javascript turned off will be able to bypass the password strength check.<br /><br />
<b>NOTE:</b> If "Javascript Check" is set to No, then a Server-Side Check will be done even if this option is set to No. If you don't want either check then you should disable this mod.
