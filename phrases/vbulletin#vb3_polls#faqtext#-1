<p>You may notice that some threads on this forum also include a section where you can vote on an issue or question. These threads are called 'polls'.</p>

<p><b>How do I create a new poll?</b></p>

<p>When you post a new thread, you may also have the option to create a poll.</p>

<p>This allows you to ask a question and specify a number of possible responses. Other members will then be able to vote for the response they wish, and the results of the voting will be displayed in the thread.</p>

<p>An example poll might be:</p>

<p>What is your favorite color?</p>

<ul>
<li>Red</li>
<li>Blue</li>
<li>Yellow</li>
<li>Green</li>
<li>Sky-blue</li>
<li>Pink with yellow spots</li>
</ul>

<p>To create a poll when you post a new thread, simply click the 'Yes, post a poll with this thread' checkbox at the bottom of the page, and set the number of possible responses you want to include.</p>

<p>When you click the submit button, you will be taken to the poll creation page, where you can specify the question and the list of responses you want to include.</p>

<p>You may also want to specify a time limit for the poll, so that (for example) it stays open for voting for only a week.</p>

<p><b>How do I vote in a poll and view the results?</b></p>

<p>To vote in a poll, simply select which option you want to vote for, and click the 'Vote!' button. Sometime you can choose more than one option. You can see the current results for a poll before you vote by clicking the 'View Results' link. Voting in a poll is entirely optional. You may vote for any of the available options, or cast no vote at all.</p>

<p>Note whether or not a poll is a public poll. If it is, any votes you cast will be attributable to you.</p>

<p>Generally, once you have voted in a poll, you will not be able to change your vote later, so place your vote carefully!</p>
