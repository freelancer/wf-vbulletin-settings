If your version of PHP supports image functions, you may enable the creation of thumbnails for images. This is the master switch to enable/disable thumbnail display. Go to Attachments -> Attachment Manager -> Edit -> Display to choose what image types will be thumbnailed. You will need to go to <b>Maintenance</b> -> <b>Update Counters</b> -> <b>Rebuild Attachment Thumbnails</b> after changing this setting.
