This option allows the user to keep their profile picture in the event that they lose permission to upload profile pictures.

If the user is moved to an usergroup that doesn't allow profile pictures; the user's picture will not be visible in their profile or on the member's list unless this option is enabled.

This option does not allow the user to change their picture. Usergroup permission is required to accomplish that task.

If the admin changes or gives an a user a profile picture when the user doesn't have usergroup permission to have one, this option will be automatically enabled.
