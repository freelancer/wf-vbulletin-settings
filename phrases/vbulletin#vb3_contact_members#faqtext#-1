<p><b>Can I email other members?</b></p>

<p>Yes. To send an email to another member, you can either find them on the <a href="memberlist.php$session[sessionurl_q]">member list</a>, or click the email user button <img class="inlineimg" src="$stylevar[imgdir_button]/email.gif" alt="Email User" /> on any post they have written.</p>

<p>This will usually open a page that contains a form where you can enter your message. When you have finished typing your message, press the 'send email' button and your message will be sent instantly.</p>

<p><b>Can I see email addresses?</b></p>

<p>For privacy reasons, the recipient's email address is not revealed to you during this process.</p>

<p><b>Why can't I send an email to someone?</b></p>

<p>If you cannot find an email button or link for a member, it means either that the administrator has disabled email functions for this forum, or that the member has said that they do not wish to receive email from other members.</p>

<p><b>Can I email a link to a friend?</b></p>

<p>Another useful email function is the ability to send a friend a link to a thread you think they may find interesting. Whenever you view a thread, you will find a link somewhere on the page which will allow you to send a brief message to anyone you like. Your referrer ID is added to the link you send, so if your friend registers on this forum as a result of viewing the link you sent to them, your referrals total will automatically be credited.</p>
