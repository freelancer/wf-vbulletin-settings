Here you may edit forum access on a user-by-user basis.<br /><br />Selecting "Yes" will allow the user access to the forum. Selecting "No" will deny the user access to the forum. Any changes made to one user's account will override the default permission settings in their usergroup.<br /><br />Selecting "Default" will revert the user to the default permissions settings for their usergroup.<br /><br />(Please note that the permission inheritance system still works here.)<br /><br />(Ensure that you have access masks enabled before attempting to use these!)
