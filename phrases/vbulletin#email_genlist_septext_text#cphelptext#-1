Enter the character or text that addresses should be separated by. What this needs to be is dependant on what program you will be feeding these addresses to. This is a space by default, but you may wish to produce, for example, CSV (in this case use a comma) or quoted CSV (use: "," in this case, including the quotes). In most email programs, a comma or semi-colon followed by a space is needed. Your needs may differ, however. To make each address be on a new line, press Enter in the text box.
