The user must have at least this number of reputation points in order to be found. This criteria can be used in conjunction with the Reputation is Less Than criteria to create a finite range of reputation points to be found. Keep in mind that if you do use both, this number must be LESS than the Reputation is Less Than number or no users will be found!
