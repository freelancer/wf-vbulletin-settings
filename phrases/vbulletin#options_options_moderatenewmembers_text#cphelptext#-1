If you enable this setting, all new users will be placed into a validation queue for you to approve before they are allowed full privileges. (You can determine what permissions these users have while they are awaiting validation by modifying the permissions for the (COPPA) Users Awaiting Moderation group.) If you also have Verify Email Address in Registration enabled, below, the user must first verify their email address, and then they will be put into the validation queue.
