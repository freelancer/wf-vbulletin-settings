$bbuserinfo[username] has just tried to attach a file that would exceed the $vboptions[attachtotalspace] byte quota you setup by $overage.

In order to allow users to continue attaching files, we recommend you delete some attachments. You can perform attachment management on the following pages:

$vboptions[bburl]/$admincpdir/attachment.php?do=intro
$vboptions[bburl]/$admincpdir/attachment.php?do=stats
