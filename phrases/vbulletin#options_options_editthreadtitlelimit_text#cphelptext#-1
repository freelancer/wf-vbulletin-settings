This setting is the number of minutes in which a user may edit the title of a thread that he starts, and have it apply to the thread listing screen (forumdisplay). After this time period, the change will only apply to the title shown in the first post of the thread. (Administrators and moderators with permission may always edit the title of the thread as shown on forumdisplay through the Edit Thread function.)
