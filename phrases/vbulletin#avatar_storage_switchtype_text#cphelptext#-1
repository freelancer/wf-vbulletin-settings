This page will allow you to move your avatars and profile pictures from the database into the file system, or, if they are in the file system, to a different directory in the file system or back into the database. Please note that if you do not have enough disk space in the intended destination, the process will fail, but your images will be safe as the images will not be removed from the database or filesystem and your storage type setting will not be changed until the end of the process. If the process aborts before the end, you will need to free up space or prune avatars before trying again.<br /><br />

If you are moving images into the file system, you will need to create a directory within your forums folder (/images/customavatars is a good one) for their storage. Unlike when you are storing attachments in the file system, this folder <b>must</b> be accessible from the web (usually CHMOD 777).<br /><br />

If you are moving images from the file system into the database, you must have enough storage space on the drive and/or partition where your database is located.
