By "language settings" we mean the settings you see when you click the [Edit Settings] link in the <a href="language.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Language Manager</a>.  If this language is just translated phrases and no custom settings then you can select "Yes" here.  Otherwise you should select "No" to keep the language whole as it is now.
