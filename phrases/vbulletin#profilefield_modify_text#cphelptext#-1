User profile fields can be displayed in posts next to the author's name.  If you want to display a profile field in posts then you need to edit your <b>postbit</b> or <b>postbit_legacy</b> template (depending on which one you use as is indicated by the "Use Legacy (Vertical) Postbit Template" option in your <a href="options.php?dogroup=stylelang&amp;do=options" target="_blank">vBulletin options</a>) and add <b>$post[fieldX]</b> where <b>X</b> is the field ID of the profile field as shown under the "Name" column on this page.<br /><br />

Below is a list of existing profile fields.  The "Title / Profile Field Type" column tells you the name and type of the profile field.  Please see the General Topics for examples of each type of profile field.<br /><br />

The "Options" column tells you which options are enabled for the corresponding profile field.  Profile fields can be required, editable, private, searchable, and shown on the <a href="../memberlist.php" target="_blank">member list</a> - or not.<br /><br />

The "Name" column tells you the field number of the corresponding profile field.  You can use a profile field's field number to make it show in user posts (see above).<br /><br />
