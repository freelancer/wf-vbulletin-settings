This is the date the user's birthday must be before to be found. The date format is yyyy-mm-dd; for example, 2002-08-30. This criteria can be used in conjunction with the Birthday is After criteria to create a finite range of birthday dates. Keep in mind that if you use them together, this date must be AFTER the Birthday is After criteria or no users will be found!
