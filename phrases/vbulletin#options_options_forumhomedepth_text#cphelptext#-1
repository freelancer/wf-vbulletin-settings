For example, if this is set to 2 and your forums are arranged like this:<br /><br />

parent<br />
--child<br />
----child's child<br /><br />

Then you will only see the first two levels on your forum homepage:<br /><br />

parent<br />
--child<br /><br />
<strong>Please Note:</strong> If this setting is set as more than two, you will need to create the appropriate templates for this depth
