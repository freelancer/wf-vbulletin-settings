<p><b>How do I change my user details?</b></p>

<p>You can change your account information using the <a href="usercp.php?$session[sessionurl_q]">User Control Panel</a>. For basic profile details (including your email address and password), click on the '<a href="profile.php?$session[sessionurl]do=editprofile">Edit Your Details</a>' option from within the User CP.
