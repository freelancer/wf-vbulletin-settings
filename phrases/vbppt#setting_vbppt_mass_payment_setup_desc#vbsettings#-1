subscription_id=>user_id=>email@paypal=>percent<br />
and place each rule on a new line. <br />
subscription_id is the ID of Paid Subscription, that gives access to some particular forum, PayPal email is the email to which the payment will be sent, and the percent is how much from each payment should be sent-out to forum owner.
