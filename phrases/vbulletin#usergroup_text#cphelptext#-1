<b>Usergroups:</b><br />
vBulletin's usergroup system, like any usergroup system, is used for managing forum permissions.  You can manage forum permissions by putting users into groups and setting permissions for the groups.  In addition, vBulletin takes usergroups to a new level by allowing users to belong to multiple groups and to submit join requests for groups.  On top of this, vBulletin lets you setup group promotions to automatically change a user's group memberships when certain conditions are met.<br /><br />

Usergroup permissions have two levels to them, the first of which is the usergroup permissions that are set in the <a href="usergroup.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Usergroup Manager</a>.  By default, a user will have these permissions everywhere on your forums.  If you want to set exceptions to default usergroup permissions then you can do so by editing usergroup permissions at the forum-level on the <a href="forumpermission.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Forum Permissions</a> page.  On the Forum Permissions page you can set group permissions on a per-forum basis.  The <a href="calendarpermission.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Calendar Permissions</a> page provides similar functionality for calendars.  Other usergroup permissions can only be set at the highest usergroup-level in the <a href="usergroup.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Usergroup Manager</a>.<br /><br />

vBulletin also allows users to belong to multiple usergroups.  There are two kinds of usergroups, primary and secondary (also called member groups).  A user can belong to only one primary group but can belong to any number of secondary groups.  A user's primary group is used to define their base forum permissions; at a minimum, a user will always have their primary group's forum permissions.  Secondary groups, on the other hand, can be used to grant additional permissions that are not granted by a user's primary group.<br /><br />

For secondary groups to be able to affect a user's permissions, the user's primary group needs to have the "Allow Users to have Member Groups" option enabled in the <a href="usergroup.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Usergroup Manager</a>.  The way the overlapping of primary and secondary permissions works is that the user is always given the "greater" of the multiple settings for the same permission.  For example, if a user's primary group has "Can View Forum" set to No and one of the same user's secondary groups has "Can View Forum" set to Yes, then the user's final setting for that permission will be Yes.  Numeric group permissions overlap in a similar way, except instead of Yes or No the user is given the more lenient of the two numbers.  Possible applications of secondary groups for forum permissions include granting access to a private forum where multiple primary groups can have access.  The primary groups in question would have null access to the private forum set on the <a href="forumpermission.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Forum Permissions</a> page.  The secondary group would have all permissions set to No in the <a href="usergroup.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Usergroup Manager</a> but would have forum-level access to the private forum set on the <a href="forumpermission.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Forum Permissions</a> page.  The result of adding a user to this secondary group would be that its "Yes" permissions for the private forum would override the null access of their primary group.  This is much more convenient than setting up redundant permissions for additional primary groups that have access to the private forum, which is what would need to be done without secondary groups.<br /><br />

If the user's primary group does not have the "Allow Users to have Member Groups" option enabled in the <a href="usergroup.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Usergroup Manager</a> then secondary group memberships will have no effect on their permissions.  Secondary groups serve no purpose in this case.  The only reason this option should be disabled in a primary group is if the group is a banned group, in which case you don't want secondary group memberships to override the null access of the banned group.<br /><br />

Another feature of vBulletin's usergroup system is the ability for users to request memberships into groups.  In this way vBulletin allows users to request forum permissions because forum permissions are controlled with group memberships.  Users can request to join a group on the <a href="../profile.php?do=editusergroups" target="_blank">Group Memberships</a> page in their User CP.  Users can only request to join custom groups that have the "Public (Joinable) Custom Usergroups" option enabled in the <a href="usergroup.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Usergroup Manager</a>.  You can manage join requests on the <a href="usergroup.php?do=viewjoinrequests" target="_blank">Join Requests</a> page.  Optionally, you can appoint group leaders in the <a href="usergroup.php?do=modify" target="_blank">Usergroup Manager</a> that can manage join requests for their group on the <a href="../profile.php?do=editusergroups" target="_blank">Group Memberships</a> page in their User CP.<br /><br />

vBulletin's usergroup system also supports group promotions based on certain conditions.  Promotions are used to change a user's group memberships when they reach a certain reputation level, number of days registered, and / or post count.  Promotions used in conjunction with user reputations can be especially powerful (see the general help topic for <a href="help.php?s=&amp;do=answer&amp;page=adminreputation&amp;pageaction=&amp;option=">User Reputations</a>).  You can manage your promotions on the <a href="usergroup.php?do=modifypromotion" target="_blank">Promotions</a> page.
