Users who type words in all CAPS will have them changed to first-letter-capitalization only, or all lowercase, depending on the word(s), if the text contains at least this many characters.<br />
If you set this to 0, this function will be disabled.<br />
For some international forums with different character sets this setting may cause issues, and in that case should be disabled.
