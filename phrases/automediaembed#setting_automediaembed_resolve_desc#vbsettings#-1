Attempt to exratct data from the destination web site. Setting this to yes will enable AME to extract the page title and embed code (if applicable). This requires a little more processing and a remote call to try and resolve the URL. If your server is not able to do this, or you don't really need this ability (i.e. you do not use containers or codes that require the embed code extracted) then turn to off (note you can use the <a href="automediaembed_admin.php?do=settings">AME CP</a> for this option)
