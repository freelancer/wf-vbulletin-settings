On this screen you can see all existing phrases. For each language you have installed, there will be a column with a series of checkmarks and "x"'s to indicate whether the phrase is or isn't translated into that language, respectively.<br /><br />

Clicking 'Edit' to the extreme right of any phrase allows you to modify, add, or remove translations for that phrase. If this is a custom phrase, there will be a link to Delete it.
