When this option is enabled a user will receive extended expiration times if given a second infraction that matches an existing active infraction.

For example, a user is given an infraction for spamming posts that expires in 1 day.  An hour later this user is given another spamming posts infraction.  Since the user already had an active spamming posts infraction, this new infraction's expiration time is added to the end time of the previous infraction.  Effectively, this new infraction  will now end 1 day and 23 hours later instead of the default of 1 day. If the user was given a third infraction, it would be added to the end of the second infraction as well.
