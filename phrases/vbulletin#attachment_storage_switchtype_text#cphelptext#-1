This process will allow you to move your attachments from the database into the file system, or, if they are in the file system, to a different directory in the file system or back into the database. Please note that if you do not have enough disk space in the intended destination, the process will fail, but your attachments will be safe as tests are done first to ensure there is enough space.<br />
Attachments will not be removed from the database or filesystem and your storage type setting will not be changed until the end of the process.<br />
If the process aborts before the end, you will need to free up space or prune attachments before trying again.<br /><br />

If you are moving attachments into the file system, it is recommended that you do *not* place the folder under your web root (usually named public_html or www or www_root) because people will be able to bypass vBulletin's permission system and download them. Also, you will need to make the folder writeable by PHP. The easiest way to do this is CHMOD it 777 (consult your FTP, Telnet, or SSH documentation for more info on how to do this). We do not recommended that you put a folder that is CHMODed 777 under your web root - another good reason to have it located above the document root.<br /><br />

If you are moving attachments from the file system into the database, you must have enough storage space on the drive and/or partition where your database is located.
