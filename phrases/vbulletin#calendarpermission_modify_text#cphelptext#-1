From here you can set custom permissions for any usergroup for a specific calendar. For each calendar you have, each usergroup is listed. If the name of the group is red, they already have custom permissions set. If the name is white, they are using default permissions. To change permissions, click Edit next to the group name you wish to change, under the calendar you wish it to apply to.
