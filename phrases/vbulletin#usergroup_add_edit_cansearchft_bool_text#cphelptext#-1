This permission allows members of this group to search your forums using the Boolean option. This permission only applies to search performed when your forum's search type is set to Fulltext.  This permission allows Boolean searches, which includes the usage of AND, OR, and NOT to limit results.  This option can be  server intensive for very large forums so its usage is cautioned.  When this permission is disabled, the Fulltext search will use a less intensive relevance based search.<br /><br />For this permission to work you must have the search engine enabled in your vBulletin options and the usergroup must also have search permission.
