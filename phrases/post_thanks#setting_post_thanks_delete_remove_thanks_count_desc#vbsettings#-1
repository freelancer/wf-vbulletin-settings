Do you want to remove user's thanks count when you delete a post/thread? Setting this option no will make it that a user's post thanks count does not go down if you delete a post. You will have to delete the thanks before you delete the post/thread if you want the post thanks count to go down. If you use the post thanks recounter, any thanks given that were deleted will not be counted.
