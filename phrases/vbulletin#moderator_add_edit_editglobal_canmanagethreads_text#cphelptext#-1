This permission covers the rest of the thread permissions (stick, merge, split, etc).<br /><br />

Sticking a thread makes it so it always appears at the top of the thread listing.  Merging allows a moderator to combine the posts of two threads into one thread.  Splitting allows a moderator to split the posts from one thread into two threads.
