If this is enabled, you can store the CSS for your pages as files which will reduce the size of pages (since the CSS file can be cached locally and referred to from each page, instead of having all the CSS information within each page). If you enable this, you must create a directory named vbulletin_css in the clientscript folder of your vBulletin installation and the web server must have permission to create, write, and remove files from that directory. (Normally this is accomplished by CHMODing the directory 777.)
